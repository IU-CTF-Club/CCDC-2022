You can use the AccessChk tool to determine what permissions are assigned to users and groups, including group-managed service accounts, for the following resources:

 - Files
 - Directories
 - Registry keys
 - Global objects
 - Windows services


AccessChk is also useful for checking whether the security settings on files and directories are set properly.
