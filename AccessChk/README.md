You can use the AccessChk tool to determine what permissions are assigned to users and groups, including group-managed service accounts, for the following resources:

 - Files
 - Directories
 - Registry keys
 - Global objects
 - Windows services


AccessChk is also useful for checking whether the security settings on files and directories are set properly. Many famous breaches have occurred when trusted insiders gained access to files on file shares where permissions were not set correctly.
